## Architecture Overview

### Core Innovation: Human-AI-Human Framework
Ki's breakthrough architecture processes both partners simultaneously while maintaining privacy:

```
Partner A → Private Channel → Ki AI Core ← Private Channel ← Partner B
                              ↓
                         Empathy AI Layer
                              ↓
                    Personalized Dual Responses
```

### LangGraph AI Engine
Core relationship intelligence workflow in `submodules/product/ki-platform/apps/langgraph-backend/src/graphs/ki_relationship_graph.py`:

```python
# Processing flow
intake → safety_check → emotional_analysis → conflict_detection 
→ anxiety_detection → empathy_processing → pattern_recognition 
→ response_generation → memory_update
```

**Key Components:**
- **Dual-partner message processing** with separate private channels
- **Emotional intelligence** with empathy AI layer
- **Conflict detection** using Thomas-Kilmann styles
- **Anxiety detection** and safety monitoring
- **Pattern recognition** for relationship dynamics
- **Personalized responses** for each partner

### Technology Stack
- **AI Engine**: LangGraph + OpenAI GPT-4 + Anthropic Claude
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
- **Frontend**: Next.js (marketing), React (app)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Automation**: n8n workflows
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose

- **[ki-automation](https://github.com/sinhadanish/ki-automation)** - Business automation workflows

### Git Commands for Repository Management

#### Automated Git Operations (Recommended)
```bash
# Check status across all repositories
make git-status

# Push all changes (submodules + main repo)
make git-push

# Pull latest from all repositories  
make git-pull
```

#### Manual Git Commands
```bash
# Clone with all submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sinhadanish/ki-startup-command-center.git

# Initialize submodules in existing clone
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Update all submodules to latest
git submodule update --remote

# Push changes to main repository
git add . && git commit -m "Update description" && git push origin main
```

#### Direct Script Execution
```bash
# For Claude Code or direct execution
./scripts/git-submodule-status.sh   # Check all repository status
./scripts/git-submodule-push.sh     # Push all changes
./scripts/git-submodule-pull.sh     # Pull all updates
```
