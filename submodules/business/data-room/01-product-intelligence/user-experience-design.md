# Ki User Experience Design Framework

## Voice-First Conversational Interface

### Design Philosophy
Ki's interface prioritizes voice-first interaction with visual elements serving as supportive context. The design creates an intimate, judgment-free environment that feels more like talking to a trusted friend than using a clinical tool.

### Core Interface Elements

#### Conversation Display
- **Clean, minimal chat interface** with large, readable text
- **Breathing space** between messages to reduce cognitive load
- **Soft, organic shapes** rather than rigid geometric forms
- **Contextual visual cues** that respond to emotional tone

#### Color Psychology Framework
- **Primary Palette**: Warm, calming tones that evoke safety
  - Sage Green (#87A96B): Growth, balance, renewal
  - Soft Blue (#A8DADC): Trust, calm, clarity
  - Warm Neutral (#F1FAEE): Clean, peaceful, open
- **Accent Colors**: 
  - Gentle Orange (#F4A261): Warmth, encouragement
  - Deep Teal (#457B9D): Stability, depth
- **Emotional State Colors**:
  - Anxiety: Soft lavender undertones
  - Conflict: Muted coral highlights
  - Harmony: Green-blue gradients

### Typography System

#### Font Hierarchy

- **Progressive disclosure** of complex insights

## Emotional Intelligence in Design

### Visual Empathy Cues

## Trust and Safety Design

### Visual Trust Indicators

### Error State Design
- **Empathetic error messages** that don't blame users
- **Graceful degradation** when voice recognition fails
- **Alternative input methods** always available
- **Clear recovery paths** from any error state
