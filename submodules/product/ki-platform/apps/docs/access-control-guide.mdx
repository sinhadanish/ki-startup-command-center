## Access Control Implementation

### Honor System Protection
Since this is a Mintlify static documentation system, protection relies on:

1. **Password Distribution Control**: Only authorized personnel receive passwords
2. **Clear Confidentiality Notices**: Legal warnings on all protected pages
3. **NDA Requirements**: All recipients must sign appropriate NDAs
4. **Access Logging**: Track who receives passwords and when
5. **Regular Review**: Quarterly access reviews and password rotation

### Legal Protections

#### Confidentiality Notices
All protected documentation includes:
- Clear confidentiality warnings
- Access control requirements  
- Contact information for questions
- NDA compliance requirements

#### Documentation Policies
- **Technical Documentation**: Internal use only, development team NDAs required
- **Investor Documentation**: Investor NDAs required, SEC compliance for material information
- **Distribution Tracking**: Maintain logs of password distribution

### Best Practices

#### For Technical Documentation (`TECH2025`)
1. **Share Via Secure Channels**: Use encrypted email or secure messaging
2. **Time-Limited Access**: Review technical team access quarterly
3. **Project-Based Sharing**: Limit access to relevant team members only
4. **Contractor Management**: Require NDAs before sharing technical passwords

#### For Investor Documentation (`INVEST2025`)
1. **Investor Verification**: Verify accredited investor status before sharing
2. **NDA Requirements**: Require signed investor NDAs before access
3. **Material Information**: Ensure compliance with securities regulations
4. **Update Frequency**: Keep financial projections and metrics current

#### Password Management
1. **Secure Distribution**: Never share passwords in unencrypted communications
2. **Regular Rotation**: Rotate passwords quarterly or after team changes
3. **Access Logging**: Maintain records of who receives access when
4. **Revocation Process**: Clear process for revoking access when needed

## Emergency Procedures

### Security Incident Response
If unauthorized access is suspected:
1. **Immediate**: Change all passwords immediately
2. **Assess**: Determine scope of potential unauthorized access
3. **Notify**: Inform all authorized users of password changes
4. **Review**: Audit access controls and improve procedures

### Password Compromise
If passwords are compromised:
1. **Rotate Immediately**: Generate new passwords
2. **Notify Users**: Send new passwords via secure channels
3. **Investigate**: Determine how compromise occurred
4. **Strengthen**: Improve distribution and storage practices
