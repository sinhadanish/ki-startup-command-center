# Ki: Relationship Intelligence Platform

Ki is the world's first Human-AI-Human relationship intelligence platform designed to transform relationship conflicts into connection through AI that understands both partners simultaneously.

## Our Mission

Transform how couples navigate relationships through AI that recognizes patterns invisible to them and guides them toward deeper connection without replacing human intimacy.

## Vision

Create a world where technology strengthens human bonds rather than replacing them, helping millions of couples develop relationship intelligence to transform conflict into connection.

## Core Innovation: Human-AI-Human Framework

Ki's breakthrough technology enables simultaneous processing of both partners while maintaining individual privacy:

- **BetterHelp** ($240-360/month): Individual therapy, not couple-focused
