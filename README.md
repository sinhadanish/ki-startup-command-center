## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Core Platform
- **Frontend**: Next.js (marketing), React Native (mobile app)
- **Backend**: FastAPI with LangGraph for AI orchestration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis for caching
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 + Anthropic Claude for empathy processing

### LangGraph AI Engine
Ki's relationship intelligence runs on a sophisticated LangGraph workflow:

```python
# Ki's core AI processing flow
intake → safety_check → emotional_analysis → conflict_detection 
→ anxiety_detection → empathy_processing → pattern_recognition 
→ response_generation → memory_update
```

### Business Automation
- **n8n Workflows**: Customer interviews, user onboarding, team notifications
- **Customer Data**: Airtable integration for user research
- **Communications**: Automated email sequences and Slack notifications

## 🎯 3-Person Team Workflow
